    "    2. **Generate Questions**: If the article is suitable for creating math questions, generate **1 to 5** questions\n",
    "    based on the richness and depth of the article content. For articles covering multiple topics, aim to generate more\n",
    "    questions to ensure coverage:\n",
    "    - Each question must be solvable independently and should not rely on answers from previous questions.\n",
    "    - If a question closely resembles the original text, append \"<original_question>\" at the end of the question.\n",
    "    - If a question is newly created, append \"<newly_created>\" at the end of the question.\n",
    "    3. **Content Alignment**: Your math questions must exclusively draw from the content of the article, ensuring\n",
    "    they are directly aligned with the concepts presented.\n",
    "    4. **Use Original Questions**: Use original questions from the article whenever possible. However, feel free to\n",
    "    rephrase them for clarity and improved understanding.\n",
    "    5. **Create New Questions**: Attempt to formulate **newly diverse and challenging questions** that explore\n",
    "    different aspects of the content presented in the article.\n",
    "    6. **Self-Contained Questions**: Ensure that each question is self-contained, meaning students do not need to\n",
    "    read the article to answer them.\n",
    "    7. **Logical Consistency**: Verify that the questions are **logically sound and directly aligned with the\n",

    "    essential to the problem’s complexity.\n",
    "    8. **Clarity and Precision**:\n",
    "    - Use precise and unambiguous language.\n",
    "    - Write all mathematical expressions or formulas in LaTeX for clarity.\n",
    "    - Clearly state all assumptions or conditions.\n",

    "    - Avoid repeating the same **concept combinations** or **computational approach** across questions.\n",

    "    challenging** (e.g., requiring multi-step computations, integrating real-world scenarios, involving abstract or\n",
    "    advanced reasoning.).\n",

    "    - Use precise and unambiguous language.\n",
    "    - Write all mathematical expressions or formulas in LaTeX for clarity.\n",
    "    - Clearly state all assumptions or conditions.\n",
    "    4. **Reference Material**:\n",
    "    - Use the provided **reference article** as a source of inspiration for generating **unique, diverse, and\n",
    "    challenging questions**.\n",
    "    - The reference material is intended to:\n",
    "    - Supplement the concept list by introducing **novel perspectives**, **contexts**, or **applications**.\n",
    "    - Help create questions that are **more complex, realistic, or uncommon** in traditional teaching scenarios.\n",
    "    - Serve as a resource to craft **real-world scenarios** or **abstract extensions** beyond the given concepts.\n",
    "    5. **Output Diversity**:\n",
    "    - Create between **1 to 5 questions**.\n",

    "    - Minimize the use of **sub-questions**, unless they are essential to the problem’s complexity.\n",
